# üêç Python Fundamentals Practice by Ramesh Nair

This repository documents my hands-on journey learning Python, the primary language used in all AI modules in my upcoming project **"Sherlock ‚Äî The AI Developer Assistant"**. 

This repo is intentionally structured for:
- Mastering Python syntax and OOP
- Practicing basic logic-building
- Strengthening file I/O, data structures, and problem-solving

## üß† Structure

- `/Basic-Python-Learning`: Variables, strings, numbers, user inputs
- `/Function`: Functions and return values
- `/LoopingPractice`: For and while loop patterns
- `/Data-Structure`: Lists, dictionaries, tuples
- `/FilesPractice`: File read/write operations
- `/OOPS`: Object-oriented programming with examples (Inheritance, Classes)
- `/Basic-Projects`: Mini beginner-friendly Python projects (Calculator, Translator, etc.)
