# This code demonstrates how to create a simple Mad Libs game.
# It takes user input for a color, a noun, and a name,
# and then prints a short poem using those inputs.
# The inputs are concatenated with the strings to form a complete message.
# Note: The above code does not handle type conversion for the inputs,
# so they will be treated as strings. This is appropriate for a Mad Libs game,
# where the inputs are expected to be text-based.
# You can further enhance the game by adding more inputs and creating a more complex story.
# You can also add error handling to ensure that the user enters valid inputs.
