# The __init__ method is a special method in Python classes that initializes the object's attributes.
# It is called when an object of the class is created.
# In this case, it initializes the attributes name, age, and roll_no for each Student object.
# The self parameter refers to the instance of the class itself, allowing access to its attributes and methods.
