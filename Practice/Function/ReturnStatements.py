# This code defines three functions: add, subtract, and multiply.
# Each function takes two parameters and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.
# The results of these operations are then printed to the console.
# The add function returns the sum of two numbers.
# The subtract function returns the difference between two numbers.
# The multiply function returns the product of two numbers.
# The results of the operations are stored in variables and printed using formatted strings.
# This code demonstrates how to define and use functions in Python.
