from math import *
# This code demonstrates how to work with numbers in Python, including integers and floating-point numbers.

my_num = 5
print(my_num)
# This code demonstrates how to create and print an integer variable in Python.

print(str(my_num) + " is my favorite number.")
# This code demonstrates how to convert an integer to a string and concatenate it with another string.
# we can't concatenate an integer directly with a string, so we convert it to a string first.

my_num = -5
print(my_num)
# This code demonstrates how to reassign an integer variable to a new value in Python.

print(abs(my_num))
# This code demonstrates how to get the absolute value of an integer in Python.

my_num = 2
print(pow(my_num, 3))
# This code demonstrates how to raise an integer to a power using the `pow` function in Python.

print(max(my_num, 10))
# This code demonstrates how to find the maximum of two numbers using the `max` function in Python.

print(min(my_num, 10))
# This code demonstrates how to find the minimum of two numbers using the `min` function in Python.

print(round(3.7))
# This code demonstrates how to round a floating-point number to the nearest integer using the `round` function in Python.
# It will automatically round up if the decimal part is 0.5 or greater.

print(round(3.2))
# This code demonstrates how to round a floating-point number to the nearest integer using the `round` function in Python.

print(3.7 + 2.5)
# This code demonstrates how to perform addition with floating-point numbers in Python.

print(floor(3.7))
# This code demonstrates how to round down a floating-point number to the nearest integer using the `floor` function from the `math` module in Python.

print(ceil(3.7))
# This code demonstrates how to round up a floating-point number to the nearest integer using the `ceil` function from the `math` module in Python.

print(sqrt(36))
# This code demonstrates how to calculate the square root of a number using the `sqrt` function from the `math` module in Python.
